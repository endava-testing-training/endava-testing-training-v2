            The idea is develop a place where anyone can learn how to become a tester.

            In that place you could find all definitions and tips to do the best testing.

            Technical and exercises in a same place to familiarize the audience with the terminology used in the testing work.

            Our purpose is to extend it to be used by different communities

            Develop an interdisciplinary application for helping young professionals becoming testers through some kind of introductory lab
